# Nurse Schedule

Simple iCalendar generator for nurse schedules

## Running

```shell
poetry install
poetry run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0
```

A simple form is exposed under `http://localhost:8000` for interaction with the generator.

## Usage

A schedule is generated by supplying a starting date (e.g. 2020-07-01) and a series of "shifts".
Shifts are specified as a single sequence of characters - `m`, `t` or `n`. Any other character
is discarded for the purposes of generating a valid calendar entry.

| Character | Description                                                                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `m`       | Morning; Generates a calendar entry from 8:00 to 16:00                                   |
| `t`       | Afternoon; Generates a calendar entry from 16:00 to 23:00                                |
| `n`       | Night; Generates a calendar entry from 22:30 the previous day to 8:00 on the current day |

Upon submission, an iCalendar file is returned with the requested sequence of shifts.
